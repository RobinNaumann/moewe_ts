# **mÅ“we** | typescript client

moewe is a open source, privacy preserving crash logging service that can be self-hosted.

## motivation

During foss development, I always wished there was a simple platform for crash reporting and knowing roughly how many people are using the software. mÅ“we aims to be exactly this without the privacy concerns of the large analytics solutions. I hope this is useful to you.

## usage

initialize the client within your Flutter applications `main.dart`

```ts
// setup Moewe
new moewe.Moewe({
  host: "open.moewe.app",
  project: "projectId",
  app: "appId",
});

render(...)
```

That's it ðŸŽ‰

you can now use the `moewe()` client within your app:

```ts
moewe().events.appOpen({});
moewe().log.debug("this is a debug message");
moewe().crash("an error occurred", null);

// report user feedback
showFeedbackPage(...)  // use package UI

// get flag value from server
moewe().config.flagString("fav_food");
```

### crash logging

You can log crashes using the `moewe.crash(...)` function. You can also use this for wrapping your application
